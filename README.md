# cosy
WatchOS app for the Smart Thermostat

## Dive right in
Cosy uses the [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) framework for web requests. It also uses [Latch](https://github.com/DanToml/Latch) to securely store data in the Keychain.

Make sure Alamofire and Latch are installed
> $ gem install cocoapods

Change into the directory where the *Podfile* is located
Install the dependencies by running
> $ pod install

One last thing..
> Open cosy.xcworkspace in Xcode to make changes instead of cosy.xcodeproj
